## Doppler Radar object detection and speed measurement

This project uses cheap (< $10) doppler radar modules from various online vendors, such as the HB100 at 10.525 GHz or the smaller CDM324 at 24 GHz. These modules are low power, short range, and intended for automatic door openers and similar purposes. They generate a weak (microphone-level) audio signal output. They can detect cars to 100+ feet and people to 30+ feet. A simple aluminum-foil horn antenna reduces sensitivity towards the side and back, and extends this range somewhat. Below is a CDM324 sensor in a small 3D printed conical horn, before applying the copper-foil tape for the reflector. The  sensor PCB is about 1 inch square. The horn front opening is 3 inches in diameter and when assembled, it picks up SUVs or trucks around 200 feet, somewhat less for small cars.

When connecting a circuit, be careful because the output pin has a DC bias, and is static sensitive, and they will usually not survive being connected incorrectly. Both modules run from +5V but there is no rejection of power-supply noise whatsoever so it may deliver no useful signal with +5V straight from a USB or switching power supply. I suspect that is why many people quickly give up on these, not realizing how critical it is to have RF-clean power.  It works on battery (4 NiMH AA cells is close enough to 5V), or a low-noise, RF-filtered supply. I use a cheap noisy 5V->12V booster ("KUNCAN 5ft USB 5v to DC 12v Step Up"), through several LC filters and ferrite beads, into a LM78L05 linear regulator back to +5V. The CDM324 draws around 30 mA at 5V.  Note the modules have a simple diode detector that will also respond to any strong local RF, so keep it away from your wifi hub and cellphone. There is a clear description of how the CDM324 works at [The Signal Path](http://thesignalpath.com/blogs/2018/08/12/tutorial-experiment-teardown-of-a-24ghz-doppler-radar-module/).

You can run the weak doppler output signal through a preamp (eg. opamp OPA209A, gain of 200x = 46 dB) and into a USB audio adaptor to get data into a Raspberry Pi (or any old phone/tablet/computer). On a Pi or other Linux based machine, ffmpeg can record the frequency signals into mp3 or wave files, and 'sox' can generate a spectrogram. A car passing by will produce a curved line on the spectogram. Remember the points on the curve are proportional to the relative *radial* velocity of the car at any given time, meaning that part of the total velocity measured directly towards or away from the sensor. For example if the radar sensor sits by the side of the road pointing to the right, and a car approaches from the right and then passes, at first the car's motion is almost directly towards the sensor (radial velocity ~ total velocity) but then radial velocity drops to zero at the moment it draws even with the sensor and passes by. After that its radial velocity goes negative as it receeds, but meanwhile it has also passed out of the radar antenna pattern, so the signal fades out at some point before reaching a frequency of 0 (not to mention the preamp is AC-coupled). It fades away more quickly when the car is travelling along the far side of the road.

These cheap radar sensors do not have an I+Q output but just a magnitude output, so you cannot directly tell apart approaching and receeding velocity. However if the sensor is pointed along the road, cars passing by towards the right and left will generate an "L" shaped curve in the spectrum with the horizontal part pointing right and left respectively, as they pass the sensor either at the start or the end of the time they are inside the sensor's field of view (see illustration above). In this way you can still tell the car's direction.  This assumes the car's speed is roughly constant; it can be harder to tell if a car slows down and stops while inside the field of view.  

Walkers or joggers generate a distictive wavy pattern (FM signal) in the spectrogram from the ~2 Hz motion of their arms and legs, and of course they move much slower than cars. As cars pass nearby the sensor, reflections from different parts of the rotating wheels generate some velocity spread. The top of the wheel is moving 2X the car speed, while the bottom of the wheel is momentarily near 0 speed. All such effects depend on reflectivity of the various parts so it is less visible on wheel hubs with a smoother profile.  If a vehicle is very close to the sensor, you may see other cars passing from different angles as the signal bounces off first one car and then another.
